                    <h3>Shrewsbury's Climate and HVAC Considerations</h3>
                    
                    <p>Shrewsbury's location in St. Louis County creates a continental climate with distinct seasons that place varying demands on HVAC systems throughout the year. The community's compact size and established development patterns create consistent climate conditions that allow for efficient HVAC system design and operation when properly planned and maintained for optimal comfort and reliability that residents depend on year-round.</p>

                    <p>Summer temperatures in Shrewsbury regularly reach the upper 80s and low 90s, with high humidity levels that can stress cooling systems and make homes uncomfortable without proper climate control. The community's diverse home styles, from mid-century properties with unique window configurations to newer homes with varying sun exposure, create different cooling challenges that our high-efficiency air conditioning and ductless mini split systems address effectively while maintaining energy efficiency and quiet operation that respects the peaceful neighborhood environment.</p>

                    <p>Winter temperatures often drop into the 20s and sometimes below, requiring robust heating systems that can maintain comfortable indoor temperatures even during the coldest weather when families depend on reliable warmth. Shrewsbury's varied home layouts, from compact efficient designs to traditional multi-level floor plans, present unique heating challenges that our cold-climate ductless mini split systems and high-efficiency heating equipment handle effectively while keeping operating costs manageable and maintaining the reliable performance that community residents expect.</p>

                    <p>Spring and fall in Shrewsbury bring pleasant weather that residents enjoy for community activities and outdoor pursuits, but these transitional seasons can also bring rapid temperature changes and varying humidity levels that benefit from systems with precise climate control.
