                    <h3>Crestwood's Climate and HVAC Considerations</h3>
                    
                    <p>Crestwood's location in St. Louis County creates a continental climate with distinct seasons that place varying demands on HVAC systems throughout the year. The community's relatively flat terrain and suburban development patterns create consistent climate conditions that allow for efficient HVAC system design and operation when properly planned and maintained for optimal family comfort and energy efficiency.</p>

                    <p>Summer temperatures in Crestwood regularly reach the upper 80s and low 90s, with high humidity levels that can stress cooling systems and make family homes uncomfortable without proper climate control. The community's diverse home styles, from ranch homes with large windows to split-level properties with varying sun exposure, create different cooling challenges that our high-efficiency air conditioning and ductless mini split systems address effectively while maintaining energy efficiency and family comfort.</p>

                    <p>Winter temperatures often drop into the 20s and sometimes below, requiring robust heating systems that can maintain comfortable indoor temperatures even during the coldest weather when families spend more time indoors. Crestwood's varied home layouts, from open-concept family areas to traditional compartmentalized floor plans, present unique heating challenges that our cold-climate ductless mini split systems and high-efficiency heating equipment handle effectively while keeping operating costs manageable for family budgets.</p>

                    <p>Spring and fall in Crestwood bring pleasant weather that families enjoy for outdoor activities and natural ventilation, but these transitional seasons can also bring rapid temperature changes and varying humidity levels that benefit from systems with precise climate control. Ductless mini splits excel during these periods, automatically adjusting to maintain optimal comfort while minimizing energy waste and supporting family activities throughout the home.</p>

                    <h3>Energy Efficiency Solutions for Crestwood Homes</h3>
